# About Mine Sweeper
This is my first game. I am happy I worked on it a different way. It felt good trying to figure out the best way to go about how to build the game. Though this is not the traditional version.

## The Original Game
If you uncover a mine, the game ends. Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing. Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding squaresâ€”information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.

## How to Play this version
To keep coding it simple. All you really would need to do is to try to not click on the bombs. They could be anywhere.

-- The glitch is that all the squares turn pink, and the player isn't able to click on each square to to keep the game going. I am not sure why this keeps happening. :/
