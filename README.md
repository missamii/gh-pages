# About Mine Sweeper
This is my first game. Unfortunately, this game is not playable. It wasn't as simple as I thought it was going to be. What I built so far is the structure in CSS and HTML. It was meant to be built with DOM and JavaScript. The game itself was an unsolved problem.

## The Original Game
If you uncover a mine, the game ends. Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing. Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding squaresâ€”information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.

## How to Play this version
To keep coding it simple. All you really would need to do is to try to not click on the bombs. They could be anywhere.
